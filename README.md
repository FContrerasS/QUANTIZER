# New_Code
A new code for N-body/Hydrodynamics simulations in astrophysics

This new code use a novel design for the adaptative mesh refinement method. 
The code is focused to small scale devices as desk computers or laptos.  
Right now the code is functional with a novel design in the AMR part, but it only can work in a secuencial way and with a sharing time-step.

The future updating will include the paralelization in both, CPU and GPU. Moreover, we will include the variable time-step for the different level of refinements.
